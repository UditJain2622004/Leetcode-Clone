## Project Description

The LeetCode Clone Project is an open-source platform for practicing coding challenges and improving your algorithmic problem-solving skills. Just like LeetCode, this clone project provides you with a web-based interface for solving coding problems in various programming languages.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up and run the LeetCode Clone Project on your local machine:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-clone.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd leetcode-clone
3. **Navigate to `Frontend` and Install the necessary packages:**
   ```bash
